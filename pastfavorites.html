    Here are some of my favorite stories that I encountered when I was a kid. One of my favorite stories that I first read during my time participating in Battle of the Books competitions is a book called The Lightning Theif by Rick Riordan. It's a story about the half god Percy Jackson, who is the son of Poseidon. His goal is the story is to return Zeus' stolen lightning bolt before it war breaks out. Reading this in the 5th grade was probably the first time that I enjoyed reading books. One of my favorite video games from early days of being a gamer is Asssassin's Creed, which is a series of video games where you get to play as a character from some time period in history, whether that be actual history or fictional history. For example, in Assasin's Creed: Odyssey, you get to play as a warrior during Ancient Greece. I've always thought that I this use of combining the future with the present was a very interesting premise, and I still am playing these games to this day.
