    Here are some of my most recent favorites. One is the anime/manga series Bleach. I've read the manga and watched the anime. Bleach tells the story of a young japanese boy who has been inherited mystical powers from generations of mystical beings, with most of those powers coming from what is known as Shinigami, who are undead warriors. The role of of the Shinigami in the story is to protect the world of the living from any serious threats. I love Bleach because it has a very extensive story with tons of lore behind each character, as well very creative powers for each of those characters. Another one of my current favorites is the video game series Tekken, which is a game mainly about the family drama of three skilled karate fighters. Because of this drama, as well as the sometimes serious, and sometimes not so serious story behind the game.
