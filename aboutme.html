<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="images/aboutme.png" width="500"  alt="About Me"> 

<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always been interested in fiction. My dad and my brother helped introduce me to many of the stories that I still love today. I would say that my most favorite types of art are usually in the form of movies, TV shows, and video games. However, when I was younger, I was really into reading books. In elementary school, I participated in Battle of the Books competitions, where I had to read a lot of different books and then during the competition, we had to answer questions about the books. But any form of media that entertains, I would be interested in checking out. I often tend to place myself in these types of stories and wonder what I would do if I possessed these powers and abilities. If I could only have one superpower, it would be the power to manipulate reality, as you can do a lot with that. </p>
